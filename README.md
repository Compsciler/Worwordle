# Worwordle

Guess the combined 8-letter word in 6 tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will
change to show how close your guess was to the word.

All words and guesses are the result of merging two 5-letter words together,
where the last two letters of the first word match the first two letters of the second word. For example, the word FRESHEEP is the word FRESH merged with the word SHEEP.

This is one of the Wordle variants I have made. The other games and instructions for creating your own Wordle variant can be found [here](https://github.com/Compsciler/Wordle-With-Score-Database/).
